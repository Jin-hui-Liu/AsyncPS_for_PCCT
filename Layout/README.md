# AsyncPS_for_PCCT

This file provides an example of how to implement the layout and post-layout simulation of the asynchronous constant-delay counter. Due to limited time, the layouts for the 
identifier and subtractor are not implemented in this work. [MagicVLSI](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/)

### Cells generation
Unlike the design flow for synchronous circuits, the physical implementation phase of asynchronous circuits cannot be fully automated by merely running scripts. This is 
primarily due to the asymmetric PRS typically generated by asynchronous circuit design methodologies, which often correspond to non-complementary logic gates. However, 
most standard cell libraries within PDKs are designed using complementary logic. Consequently, designers cannot directly map their netlists to the standard cell library, 
necessitating the manual layout of these non-complementary cells.

### Post-layout

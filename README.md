# AsyncPS_for_PCCT
## Digital asynchronous event-based circuits for photon detection in modern CT scans

This repository contains the entire AsyncPS project, from algorithmic graph extraction and GNN training to hardware description files (RTL in SystemVerilog and C software for interfacing) and an example on-FGPA deployment. Each part of the work contains its own README file with its set of instructions, file structure and source codes. This repository consists of two main parts:
